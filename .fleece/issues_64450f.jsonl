See logs below. I believe this may be due to the worktree path not being found - the worktree and folder does exist when I review the flie system, but it is named \u0022issues/feature/improve-tool-output-aLP3LH\u0022 rather than \u0022issues/feature/improve-tool-output\u002BaLP3LH\u0022, which is the branch name. Try to replicate this issue in an integration test by creating a new worktree \u0022issues/feature/improve-tool-output-aLP3LH\u0022, creating a mock GitHub PR service with the branch name \u0022issues/feature/improve-tool-output\u002BaLP3LH\u0022 and trying to start an agent with the \u0022None\u0022 agent based on the branch name that is coming from the PR.
