The aim is to provide an environment switch for the application that, when enabled, swaps out the live services for the mocks. This will allow a test application to be run that does not persist and affect any production data.\n\nCreate a test data store that has in memory persistence to allow adding and deleting data.\n\nMuch of this probably already exists in the test libraries. Do not recreate it - migrate it to the main project into a test folder and refactor the tests to use this data.","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T21:03:09.5941398+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Closed","statusLastUpdate":"2026-01-28T01:39:48.3958495+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","type":"Task","typeLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","previousIssues":[],"previousIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","previousIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","group":"ui","groupLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","groupModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-01-28T01:39:48.3958495+00:00","createdAt":"2026-01-27T20:55:48.8300957+00:00"}
